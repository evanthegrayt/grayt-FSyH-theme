# grayt-FSyH-theme [WIP]
My personal, colorful theme for the `fast-syntax-highlighting` `zsh` plugin.

## Installation
You should already have
[fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)
installed, but if not, follow the instructions on their `README.md`.

Once `F-Sy-H` is installed, clone this repository, and run the
`fast-theme` function, passing the [ini file](themes/grayt.ini) as the
argument:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/evanthegrayt/grayt-FSyH-theme.git
fast-theme grayt-FSyH-theme/themes/grayt.ini
```
Script away in your terminal, now complete with an awesome -- nay, GRAYT --
color-scheme!

## This is a Work-In-Progress
There are a few highlights that I haven't figured out yet. I've marked these
with `TODO` in the `ini` file, and switched them to a bright green background
(`bg:10`) so if I see something with that color, I can determine what it is.

That being said, if you see anything with bright green background color, or just
know what these keywords highlight, please [submit an
issue](https://github.com/evanthegrayt/grayt-FSyH-theme/issues/new) with a
screenshot so I can add a real color to it.

## Self-Promotion
I do these projects for fun, and I enjoy knowing that they're helpful to people.

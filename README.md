# grayt-FSyH-theme
[UNDER CONSTRUCTION] My personal, colorful theme for the
[fast-syntax-highlighting zsh plugin](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting).

I'm still playing around with the colors. When I'm finished, I will update the
repo to include installation info, etc.

In the meantime, here's a screenshot of how it currently looks.

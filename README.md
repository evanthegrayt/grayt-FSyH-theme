# grayt-FSyH-theme
[UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Colorful theme for the fast-syntax-highlighting zsh plugin.

I'm still playing around with the colors. When I'm finished, I will update the
repo to include installation info, etc.

In the meantime, you can view a [screenshot](resource/grayt.jpg) of
how it currently looks.
